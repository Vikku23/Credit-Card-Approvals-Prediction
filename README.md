# Credit-Card-Approvals-Prediction

Predicting Credit Card Approvals using Machine Learning
Credit cards are one of the most commonly used financial tools. However, obtaining a credit card can be a difficult task for many individuals due to various factors such as income level, and employment status. To help streamline the application process and improve the approval rate, machine learning models can be used to predict credit card approval.
In this project, we will explore how various factors affect credit card approval rates and use predictive models to improve the accuracy of credit card approval predictions.

Conclusion
The Machine Learning Model is able to predict Credit Card Approvals with an enhanced accuracy of 93%.
The Random Forest model achieves an accuracy of 93%, demonstrating its ability to capture dataset patterns and make accurate predictions for the majority of cases. The hyperparameter tuning performed using GridSearchCV further enhances the model's accuracy to 92.90%. This suggests that the model could be suitable for your specific use case.
